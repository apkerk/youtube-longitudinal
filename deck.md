# The Rhetoric of Decks

## What This Document Is

Tacit knowledge for effective slide presentations — the unwritten rules that govern what makes a deck work.

## The Fundamental Tension

A deck exists between two failure modes:

1. **The document pretending to be slides**: Walls of text. Speaker becomes redundant.
2. **The mystery slides**: So sparse they're meaningless without the speaker.

A good deck is *incomplete on purpose* but *structured enough* to scaffold understanding.

## Core Principles

### 1. One Idea Per Slide
Each slide is one idea. Not one topic. One *idea*.

Test: Can you state the slide's idea in one sentence?

### 2. Titles Are Assertions, Not Labels

**Weak**: "Results"  
**Strong**: "Women receive 18% fewer views on average"

If someone reads only your slide titles, they should understand your argument.

### 3. The Pyramid Principle
Lead with the conclusion. Then support it.

Structure:
1. Here's what I'm going to tell you (the claim)
2. Here's the evidence for it
3. Here's why it matters

### 4. Visual Hierarchy Is Meaning
What's big is important. What's first is important.

Use size, position, and space to do cognitive work for the audience.

### 5. Bullets Are a Confession of Defeat
Usually there's a structure hiding in your bullets:
- A sequence (first, then, finally)
- A contrast (on one hand, on the other)
- A hierarchy (main point, supporting details)
- A causal chain (because of X, we see Y)

Find the structure. Make it visible.

### 6. Tables and Figures Carry the Weight
- Highlight the one or two key results
- Use color or boxes to draw the eye
- The figure should be readable from the back of the room

### 7. Repetition Is Structure
Tell them what you'll tell them. Tell them. Tell them what you told them.

### 8. Transitions Are Invisible Architecture
"So we've established X. Now the question is Y."

### 9. The Audience Is Not You
They need:
- The main point, stated clearly
- Enough evidence to believe it
- A reason to care

The deck is the trailer, not the movie.

### 10. Anxiety Makes Decks Worse
Dense slides are harder to present. Sparse slides force you to know your material.

## Technical Excellence

### Preventing LaTeX Errors
- Test figure sizes explicitly (use `width=0.85\textwidth` or smaller)
- Break long lines explicitly
- Test table column widths

### Design Standards
- Figures fit completely within slide boundaries
- Text readable from back of room (minimum 12pt)
- Consistent font sizes for similar content
- Sufficient color contrast

## Progress Decks (Internal Documentation)

**Universal Rule:** Show what you've found AND what you've ruled out.

For each major finding, include:
1. What we found (positive result)
2. What we ruled out (alternatives tested)
3. What's still open (remaining questions)

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] No overfull box warnings
- [ ] All figures fit within boundaries
- [ ] All text readable
- [ ] Consistent formatting
- [ ] Professional appearance
