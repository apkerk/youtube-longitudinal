# Progress Log: YouTube Longitudinal Data Collection

**Purpose:** Chronological record of all work completed on this project  
**Update Instructions:** Add new entries at the TOP of each month's section

---

## Current Status (as of Feb 17, 2026)

**Phase:** Production — Daily channel stats on Mac Mini + AI Creator Census COMPLETE.
**Roadmap Position:** Channel stats collecting daily via launchd. AI census discovered 5,026 channels. Video enumeration still running on laptop. Streams A-D deployment in progress (separate agent).
**Data Quality Status:** 9,760 panel channels; 9,672 return valid stats. AI census: 5,026 unique channels, 0 nulls, 41 overlap with gender gap panel.
**Next Steps:**
1. Verify 3 AM automated channel stats run (check 2026-02-18.csv)
2. Enumeration finishes → SCP inventory → weekly video stats go live
3. Analyze AI census overlap with gender gap panel (41 channels)
4. Gender code AI census channels (deferred per design decision)

### Feb 16, 2026 — 08:30 PM [AI Creator Census — COMPLETE]
- **Ran production AI Creator Census:** 5,026 unique channels discovered across 14 of 17 search terms (hit target before exhausting all terms).
- Output: `data/channels/ai_census/initial_20260217.csv` (33 columns, 5,026 rows, 0 nulls, 0 duplicates)
- Added **checkpoint/resume** to `discover_ai_creators.py`: incremental CSV writes + JSON checkpoint after each term. Fixed `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warning.
- Quota consumed: estimated ~100K units (under 10% of daily limit). Ran in under 3 minutes.
- **Discovery keyword distribution:** AI voice (454), artificial intelligence (389), AI tutorial (388), prompt engineering (387), AI video editing (379), Sora AI (373), DALL-E (370), AI tools (366), agentic AI (342), generative AI (335), Claude Code (317), ChatGPT (316), AI automation (307), Midjourney tutorial (303)
- **Country distribution:** India (1,093), US (1,053), Unknown (1,345), GB (145), IT (140), PK (113), CA (98)
- **Overlap with gender gap panel:** 41 channels appear in both datasets
- What's next: Gender coding for AI census channels, AI adoption detection layer (keyword matching on video titles/descriptions)



## Feb 2026

### Feb 16, 2026 — 08:42 PM [Shell Script for Channel ID Extraction]
- **Built `scripts/extract_channel_ids.sh`** — utility script to extract channel_id column from any discovery output CSV and write clean channel list suitable for `daily_stats.py --channel-list`
- Features: automatic column detection, deduplication, sorted output, error handling (file checks, column validation), usage message
- Takes 2 args: INPUT_CSV and OUTPUT_CSV
- Output format: CSV with single "channel_id" column, sorted unique IDs
- Example usage: `./scripts/extract_channel_ids.sh data/channels/stream_b/initial_20260217.csv data/channels/stream_b/channel_ids.csv`
- Tested: usage message displays correctly when called with no args
- What's next: Use this script for Streams A-D channel list prep after discovery runs complete

### Feb 16, 2026 — 08:15 PM [Channel Stats Decoupled from Video Inventory]
- **Added `--channel-list` CLI arg to `daily_stats.py`** so channel-only mode reads from `channel_ids.csv` directly, bypassing the video inventory entirely. This unblocks daily channel stats collection while video enumeration is still in progress.
- New `load_channel_list()` method reads any CSV with a `channel_id` column. Falls back to inventory-based loading when `--channel-list` not provided (backward compatible).
- Validation logic updated: `--video-inventory` no longer required when `--mode channel` + `--channel-list` are both set. Still required for `--mode video` and `--mode both`.
- Guard added to `detect_and_add_new_videos()`: skips cleanly when no inventory path is set.
- **Tested on laptop:** 9,760 channels loaded, 9,672 stats collected (~50s). 88 channels returned not_found (terminated/deleted accounts).
- **Deployed to Mac Mini via SSH (192.168.86.48):**
  - `git pull` brought code up to date
  - Updated launchd plist: replaced `--video-inventory` with `--channel-list data/channels/gender_gap/channel_ids.csv`
  - Unloaded/reloaded plist, verified all 4 services in `launchctl list`
  - **Tested on Mac Mini:** 9,760 channels loaded, 9,672 stats collected (~100s). Output: `data/daily_panels/channel_stats/2026-02-17.csv`
- **Mac Mini now collecting full panel daily** (was only 2 channels before from partial inventory)
- What's next: Verify 3 AM launchd run produces 2026-02-18.csv. Continue video enumeration on laptop.

### Feb 16, 2026 — 07:55 PM [Mac Mini Deployed + Health Monitoring Built]
- **Deployed to Mac Mini via SSH** (192.168.86.48) — full Steps 1-7 from deployment guide
  - Cloned repo, installed deps (Python 3.9.6 on Mac Mini, not 3.14), copied config + data
  - Created and loaded 4 launchd services: daily-channel-stats, weekly-video-stats, sync-to-drive, health-check
  - Ran test collection: 2 channel stats collected (partial inventory on Mac Mini)
- **Built health check system** (`src/validation/health_check.py`) — 9 checks:
  channel freshness, channel completeness, video freshness, video completeness,
  log errors, inventory integrity, disk space, quota usage, stale checkpoints.
  Outputs HEALTHY/DEGRADED/FAILING. Supports --json. Runs daily at 12:00 UTC via launchd.
- **Built weekly digest** (`src/validation/weekly_digest.py`) — markdown summary of
  collection coverage, growth trends, data volume. Run manually or schedulable.
- **Fixed Mac Mini details:** IP was .41 (wrong), corrected to .48. Python is 3.9.6 not 3.14.
  Drive sync from laptop to Mac Mini can be stale — use scp for critical files.
- **Discovered Drive sync issue:** Files copied from Drive mount on Mac Mini had stale data
  (channel_ids.csv had 14,170 rows instead of 9,761). Used scp from laptop to push correct files.
- **Enumeration status:** 143/9760 channels done (~1.5%), still running on laptop.
  Once complete, scp inventory to Mac Mini for full production.
- Health check ran on Mac Mini: DEGRADED (expected — partial inventory, no video stats yet).
  All infrastructure checks pass (disk 37.6%, no errors, no stale checkpoints).
- What's next: Wait for enumeration, scp inventory, run full collection, verify 3 AM automation.

### Feb 16, 2026 — 09:45 PM [Production Launch + Mac Mini Handoff]
- **Regenerated channel_ids.csv** to 9,760 coded channels (filtered from 14,169 to only those with both gender + race)
- **Regenerated channel_metadata.csv** to match (9,760 rows with channel_id, perceivedGender, race, runBy, subscriberCount, viewCount)
- **Updated daily_stats.py** with `--mode channel|video|both` flag for dual-cadence collection
- **Launched video enumeration** on 9,760 channels (background, checkpoint/resume). ~80/9760 channels done at session end. Expected ~12M videos, ~245K API units total.
- **Created two launchd plists** (daily channel stats + weekly video stats). Created on laptop then unloaded — will be recreated with local paths on Mac Mini.
- **Wrote docs/PANEL_SCHEMA.md** — full dual-cadence schema documentation with field definitions, join examples, and storage projections
- **Wrote docs/MAC_MINI_DEPLOYMENT.md** — 9-step deployment guide for next agent. Covers: local-first I/O (EDEADLK avoidance), git clone, deps, config, data copy, plists with local paths, sync-to-drive script, testing, and troubleshooting.
- **Key insight from Second Brain:** Google Drive FUSE + launchd = deadlock. Must use local I/O on Mac Mini with rsync/osascript sync to Drive. Same pattern as Pat bot.
- Storage projection: ~40 GB/year (was 416 GB with daily + full panel). Quota: ~3.5% of daily limit average.
- What's next: Enumeration finishes (resume if interrupted). Next agent deploys to Mac Mini per docs/MAC_MINI_DEPLOYMENT.md.

### Feb 16, 2026 — 08:00 PM [Panel Design Decisions + Provenance]
- **DECISION: Panel restricted to 9,760 channels** with both gender AND race coded (excludes blank + undetermined). Uncoded channels lack identifiable creators, less analytically useful.
- **DECISION: Dual-cadence collection** — daily channel stats (tiny: ~195 API units/day, 1.1 MB/day), weekly video stats (~240K units, ~756 MB). daily_stats.py updated with `--mode channel|video|both` flag.
- Storage projections for coded panel: 269 GB/year (was 416 GB for full panel). Daily quota ~24% (was 37%).
- Added `source` column to `clean_baileys.py` — all channels tagged `source="infludata"` for provenance tracking
- Re-ran clean_baileys.py: all validations pass, 14,169 rows, 515 dupes removed
- What's next: regenerate channel_ids.csv for 9,760 coded subset, run enumeration, set up launchd

### Feb 16, 2026 — 07:21 PM [Infrastructure Slide Deck — Complete]
- Built 10-slide LaTeX Beamer deck (`output/youtube-longitudinal-infrastructure-deck.tex`) documenting the full data collection infrastructure
- Custom theme: navy/amber/slate palette, 16:9 aspect ratio, progressive reveal overlays
- Covers: two research programs, panel composition (14,169 channels with gender/race breakdown), three-dataset architecture (TikZ flow diagram), schemas with sample data rows, 5-stream sampling design, AI Creator Census (17 terms + 3 research designs), future enrichment pipeline, quota budget (29,300 units/day = 2.9%)
- Full deck-compile protocol: 3 compilation passes, second-agent narrative review, third-agent graphics audit
- Final PDF: 19 pages (with overlays), 0 overfull hbox/vbox warnings
- Fixes applied from reviews: woman % 24.4→24.5 (rounding), "parallel"→"same run" on TikZ arrow, clarified 7-field schema label
- What's next: Katie reviews deck; production runs still awaiting approval

### Feb 16, 2026 — 07:15 PM [Status Review + Slide Deck Prompt]
- Confirmed all 4 agents completed and all scripts test-verified
- Wrote agent prompt for infrastructure overview slide deck (Beamer, 10-12 slides)
- Identified next session priorities: (1) full video enumeration, (2) first daily stats run, (3) launchd automation, (4) AI Creator Census
- What's next: Run enumeration in new session, then set up daily automation

### Feb 16, 2026 — 06:41 PM [Gender Gap Panel — Full Infrastructure Build]
- Built complete gender gap panel infrastructure via 4-agent parallel strategy (A: data prep, B: API infra, C: collection scripts, D: AI census)
- **Data prep (Agent A):**
  - Created `src/collection/clean_baileys.py` — parses Bailey's xlsx with openpyxl header-based lookup, fixes 6 race typos, deduplicates 515 duplicate rows → 14,169 unique channels
  - Produced 3 output files: `data/processed/gender_gap_panel_clean.csv` (30 cols), `data/channels/gender_gap/channel_ids.csv`, `data/channels/gender_gap/channel_metadata.csv`
  - Updated `src/config.py` with 9 new paths, AI_SEARCH_TERMS (17 terms), 4 new schemas, get_daily_panel_path() helper
- **API infrastructure (Agent B):**
  - Added `get_all_video_ids()` to youtube_api.py — full playlist pagination with checkpoint/resume
  - Added `get_video_stats_batch()` — lean video stats fetch (part="statistics" only)
  - Added quota tracking to `execute_request()` — logs to data/logs/quota_YYYYMMDD.csv (backward compatible)
  - Created `__init__.py` for panels/, enrichment/, analysis/ modules
- **Collection scripts (Agent C):**
  - Created `src/collection/enumerate_videos.py` — builds video inventory with checkpoint/resume, UC→UU playlist conversion
  - Created `src/panels/daily_stats.py` — DailyStatsCollector class with 4-step pipeline (video stats → channel stats → save → new video detection)
- **AI census (Agent D):**
  - Created `src/collection/discover_ai_creators.py` — video-first search across 17 AI terms, 12-month time windows, order="relevance"
- **Test verification results (all passing):**
  - clean_baileys: 14,169 rows, all validations pass, race typos corrected
  - enumerate_videos --test --limit 2: 1,038 videos from 2 channels, correct 5-col schema
  - daily_stats --test: 250 video stats + 2 channel stats, daily panel files correct
  - discover_ai_creators --test --limit 5: 107 AI channels found
  - Backward compatibility: discover_intent.py and sweep_channels.py still import correctly
  - Quota tracking: data/logs/quota_20260216.csv being written
- Installed all Python deps for Python 3.14: openpyxl, pyyaml, pandas, tqdm, isodate, google-api-python-client
- What's next: Katie approves full video enumeration run, then start daily panel collection

### Feb 16, 2026 — 04:30 PM [AI Design Integration — Planning & Scope Expansion]
- Read and evaluated design document (`SECOND_BRAIN/03-research/YOUTUBE_DATASET_DESIGN.md`) — three new research designs: AI Creator Census, AI Adoption Diffusion Panel, Audience Response
- Audited all existing Python scripts against proposed architecture. Mapped reusable code vs. gaps.
- Analyzed both raw data files: confirmed 14,169 unique channels, 100% overlap between Infludata and Bailey's lists
- **Corrected misdiagnosis:** Bailey's xlsx does NOT have 4,097 misaligned rows. Those channels have BLANK gender/race (uncoded). Apparent misalignment was from parsing xlsx cells positionally instead of by cell reference.
- **SCOPE EXPANSION (Katie-approved):** This repo now owns longitudinal data collection on the 14,169 gender gap channels. Gender gap paper analysis stays in CH2. Updated CLAUDE.md.
- Resolved all 9 methodological decisions with Katie: all 14,169 channels, broad AI search terms, keyword-first AI detection, randomized comment sampling, partitioned CSVs to start
- Created new directory structure: `src/panels/`, `src/enrichment/`, `src/analysis/`, `data/channels/gender_gap/`, `data/channels/ai_census/`, `data/video_inventory/`, `data/daily_panels/{video_stats,channel_stats}/`, `data/transcripts/`, `data/comments/`, `logs/`
- Wrote full implementation plan: `.claude/plans/cached-knitting-puffin.md`
- Wrote agent handoff document: `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
- What's next: Hand off to parallel agents for implementation (data prep, API infrastructure, collection scripts, AI census)

### Feb 16, 2026 — 02:15 PM [Project Restructuring]
- Flattened project from triple-nested `youtube-longitudinal/youtube-longitudinal/youtube-longitudinal/` to root-level layout
- Production code (`src/`) moved from Level 3 to root; all `Path(__file__)` relative paths verified working
- Created project CLAUDE.md with session protocol, safety rules, coding standards
- Added `.claude/rules/` (01-session-protocol, 02-data-collection)
- Added `.claude/skills/log-update/` for session-end commit+push workflow
- Moved 4 existing analysis skills (stata-regression, r-econometrics, python-panel-data, referee-audit) to root `.claude/skills/`
- Detailed docs from Level 2 promoted to root (PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN, PROGRESS_LOG, TECHNICAL_SPECS, DECISION_LOG)
- Reference docs (API variable ref, sampling experiments, quota analysis) moved to `docs/`
- Updated `.gitignore` (comprehensive: data, secrets, artifacts, archive, output)
- Archived: v1 legacy scripts, superseded rule files (AI_RULES, ANTIGRAVITY_RULES, MY_WORKFLOW), loose conversation/template files, stray 656MB .dta file (confirmed duplicate of dissertation copy)
- Removed nested `.git/` repository (history captured in commit message)
- Resolved merge conflict with remote (b527cb0 production commit)
- What's next: install Python deps, then start production collection

### Feb 02, 2026 — 05:30 PM (Late Evening Session)
**Session Focus:** Full Production Pipeline Implementation

**Work Completed:**
- **Complete Rewrite:** Built production-grade modular architecture with 15 new files
- **Configuration System:** Created `config.py` with comprehensive constants:
  - 8-language keyword mappings (Intent + Non-Intent)
  - Full YouTube topic hierarchy (200+ topics with decoding)
  - Stream-specific directories and targets
  - Data schemas for channels, videos, sweeps
- **Enhanced API Module:** Upgraded `youtube_api.py` with:
  - Full topic extraction and decoding (hierarchical topics)
  - Comprehensive channel details (28 fields for initial, 8 for sweeps)
  - Video batch fetching with Shorts classification
  - New video detection for longitudinal tracking
  - Search helpers with pagination
- **Collection Scripts (5):**
  - `discover_intent.py` — Stream A: Intent creators (200k target)
  - `discover_non_intent.py` — Stream A': Non-intent creators (200k target)
  - `discover_benchmark.py` — Stream B: Algorithm favorites (2k)
  - `discover_random.py` — Stream C: Random prefix (50k)
  - `discover_casual.py` — Stream D: Casual uploaders (25k)
- **Sweep System:**
  - `sweep_channels.py` — Main sweep with checkpoint/resume
  - `detect_new_videos.py` — New video detection logic
- **Validation:**
  - `validate_sweep.py` — Data quality checks (duplicates, anomalies, policy changes)
- **Testing:** 
  - Stream A test: 62 Hindi channels collected successfully
  - Stream D test: 15 casual channels collected successfully
  - Validation: 0 errors, all systems operational

**Sample Size Decision:**
- Updated Stream A and A' from 25k → **200k each** to handle attrition
- Rationale: Early-stage creator dropout is 50-70%; need huge buffer
- Expected English channels: 50k-80k per stream (sufficient for analysis)

**Quota Impact:**
- Initial collection (2 streams, 400k channels): ~808k units (fits in 1 day)
- Recommendation: Use `--skip-first-video` flag for speed
- Can enrich with first video data later if needed

### Feb 02, 2026 — 04:30 PM (Evening Session)
**Session Focus:** Comprehensive Sampling Methodology Validation & Quad-Stream Design

**Work Completed:**
- **Experiment Battery:** Ran 6 systematic experiments testing sampling strategies:
  - EXP-001/003: Bias Profile Comparison (Vowels vs Raw vs Random Prefix)
  - EXP-002/010: New Creator Yield Rates (Intent vs Non-Intent keywords)
  - EXP-005: Channel ID Enumeration (result: not viable)
  - EXP-006: Language Bias Detection (8 languages tested)
  - EXP-007: Region Code Impact
  - EXP-008: Pagination Depth Bias
- **Critical Discovery:** English-only keywords miss 86% of findable new creators. Hindi has highest yield (35.3%).
- **Design Evolution:** Upgraded from Triple-Stream to Quad-Stream design with Stream D (Amateur Baseline).
- **Documentation Created:**
  - `SAMPLING_EXPERIMENTS.md` — Full experiment log with results
  - `QUOTA_ANALYSIS.md` — Sample size and polling frequency analysis
  - `test_sampling_battery.py` — Comprehensive test script
  - `test_language_pagination.py` — Language and pagination experiments
  - `discover_amateur.py` — Stream D collection script
  - `discover_cohort_multilingual.py` — Enhanced 8-language cohort discovery

**Key Findings:**
| Finding | Evidence | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Vowel search massively biased | 1.16M median views, 94% big channels | Relabeled as "Algorithm Favorites" |
| English misses 86% of creators | 38 vs 271 across 8 languages | MUST use multilingual |
| Hindi highest yield | 35.3% vs 30.9% English | Prioritize Hindi |
| Pagination doesn't help | Page 2 higher views than Page 1 | Abandon strategy |
| Polling is cheap | 130k channels = 2,600 units/day | Daily polling feasible |

**Quota Analysis Summary:**
- Recommended panel: 130,000 channels (50k A + 10k B + 50k C + 20k D)
- Daily polling cost: 2,600 units (0.26% of quota)
- Collection budget: 500,000 units/day
- 80%+ quota remains for flexibility/experiments

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `SAMPLING_EXPERIMENTS.md` (Created)
- `QUOTA_ANALYSIS.md` (Created)
- `TECHNICAL_SPECS.md` (Major update — Quad-Stream)
- `PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md` (Updated findings & design)

- `src/test_language_pagination.py` (Created)
- `src/discover_amateur.py` (Created)
- `src/discover_cohort_multilingual.py` (Created)
- `config/config.yaml` (Created with API key)

**Next Steps (Production Ramp-Up):**
1. Run 24-hour multilingual cohort collection
2. Run amateur baseline collection
3. Set up automated daily polling
4. Design hybrid polling tiers (hot/warm/cold)

### Feb 02, 2026 — 03:00 PM
**Session Focus:** Methodological Pivot to Triple-Stream Design

**Work Completed:**
- **Bias Diagnostics:** Ran empirical tests comparing "Vowel Search" (Median Views 652k) vs "Random Prefix" (Median Views 22).
- **Sampling Strategy:** Validated that a single "Random" sample is insufficient.
- **Design Pivot:** Adopted "Triple-Stream" approach (Intentional A + Visible B + Deep Random C).
- **Scripting:** Created `discover_cohort.py` (Stream A) and `discover_random.py` (Stream B initial version).
- **Documentation:** Consolidated artifacts into `PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md` and `TECHNICAL_SPECS.md`.

**Key Findings:**
- **"Filing for Videos" (Zhou et al.):** Confirmed as reference for Random Prefix Sampling.
- **Quota Capacity:** We have effectively infinite quota (1M/day) for this scale, allowing us to run all three streams simultaneously.

**Decisions Made:**
- **Triple-Stream Design:** (See `DECISION_LOG.md` entry 001). Chosen to control for survivorship bias while checking market competitiveness.
- **Vowel Rotation:** Used for Stream B to ensure linguistic coverage of the "Visible" market.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`: Created (Canonical roadmap).
- `TECHNICAL_SPECS.md`: Created (Canonical specs).
- `DECISION_LOG.md`: Created (Canonical decision record).
- `src/test_bias_deep_dive.py`: Created (Diagnostic tool).

**Next Steps (Immediate):**
1. Clean up redundant documentation (`implementation_plan.md`, `sampling_methodology.md`).
2. Finalize script names.

### Feb 02, 2026 — 03:15 PM
**Session Focus:** Deep Review of Sampling Strategy & Script Logic

**Work Completed:**
- **Strategy Deep Dive:** Conducted literature review on "Snowball Sampling" vs "Random Prefix" vs "External Lists." Created `sampling_strategy_review.md`.
- **Code Audit:** Analyzed `discover_cohort.py` and `discover_visible.py` to document exact search keywords and query logic (`q` searches snippets, not just titles).
- **Validation:** Confirmed "Stream C" (Deep Random) logic: inherently captures 99% nonsense to prove the 1% signal is distinct.
- **Cleanup:** Renamed `discover_random.py` -> `discover_visible.py` to clarify its role as "Market Baseline."
- **Deleted:** Redundant artifacts (`task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, etc.) after consolidation.

### Feb 02, 2026 — 03:30 PM
**Session Focus:** Project Setup & Git Initialization

**Work Completed:**
- **Git Initialization:** Initialized local repository and created `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive/large files.
- **GitHub Link:** Successfully linked local repo to `apkerk/youtube-longitudinal` and pushed `main` branch.
- **Documentation Audit:** Created missing standard files (`MY_WORKFLOW.md`, `writing-patterns.md`, `deck.md`) from templates to ensure full compliance with the research system.
- **Folder Structure:** created `drafts/` and `archive/` directories.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `.gitignore`: Created.
- `MY_WORKFLOW.md`: Created.
- `writing-patterns.md`: Created.
- `deck.md`: Created.

**Next Steps (Immediate):**
1. 🛑 USER ACTION REQUIRED: Run the 3-step validation suite to confirm network access.
2. Set up `launchd` for daily automation.

**Key Findings:**
- **Stream A Keywords:** Validated list (`Welcome`, `Intro`, `Vlog 1`) targets intentionality.
- **Stream C Logic:** Confirmed that "Nonsense" results are a *feature*, not a bug, providing a true Zero Baseline.
- **Alternatives Rejected:** "Snowball Sampling" rejected due to Homophily Bias (echo chambers).

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `sampling_strategy_review.md`: Created (Comparative analysis).
- `src/discover_visible.py`: Renamed and updated docstrings.
- `src/discover_deep_random.py`: Created.

**Next Steps (Immediate):**
1. 🛑 USER ACTION REQUIRED: Run the 3-step validation suite to confirm network access.
2. Set up `launchd` for daily automation.
