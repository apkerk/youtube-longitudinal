## Statistical Reporting (Quantitative Projects)

### Basic Format
The analysis reveals a significant effect ($\beta = X.XX$, $SE = X.XX$, $p < 0.001$).

### With Confidence Intervals
The effect persists ($\beta = X.XX$, 95% CI $[X.XX, X.XX]$, $p < 0.001$).

### Effect Sizes
Report effect sizes alongside significance tests when possible.

## Causal Language

**❌ AVOID (unless causal design):**
- "causes"
- "leads to"
- "results in"

**✅ USE INSTEAD:**
- "is associated with"
- "predicts"
- "is related to"
- "suggests"

---

## Reporting Sample Sizes

**Always include N:**
The analysis includes $N = X,XXX$ [units].

---

## Punctuation Preferences

### Em-Dashes
**Avoid em-dashes in text content.** Instead, use:
- **Commas** for parenthetical asides
- **Parentheses** for explanatory clauses
- **Colons** for elaborations
- **Semicolons** where appropriate

## Citation Patterns

### In-Text

Author-year: Smith (2020) argues...
